This is a collection of links for Destiny 2 that I have found useful. This exists to share with players of Destiny 2.

## The Links

[Destiny Item Manager](https://app.destinyitemmanager.com/) allows players to manage many aspects across your guardians and vault.

[Braytech](https://bray.tech/) is a well designed checklist interface with information about your guardian and the world they exist in.

[Destiny Optimizer](https://destinyoptimizer.com/) gives players guidance for optimizing the how and where to acquire gear for their guardians.

[Today In Destiny](https://www.todayindestiny.com/) provides an at a glance view into what events are happening in the world of Destiny 2.
